  Zero-dep size budget. Reads spektrum.min.js, gzips it via Node's
  built-in zlib, and exits non-zero if either raw or gzipped exceeds
  the cap. Run after build; wired into CI as a gate.

  Why custom: pulling in size-limit (or any of the other size tools)
  would contradict the "audit it in an afternoon" pitch with a
  transitive-dep tail dozens deep. zlib is built into Node.

  Tune the caps below as the surface area grows. Today the engine
  prints around 8.5 kB raw / 4 kB gzipped; caps are bumped to 9216 / 4096
  to absorb the audit-response security fixes (PRs 1–3).
